# ai-meta-ad-quality-assurer

A fully client-side tool that evaluates Meta (Facebook) static ads for copy quality and creative clarity.  
It provides a 10-point score, reasons, suggestions, and flags — all in your browser.

## 🚀 Publish on GitHub Pages
1. Upload all files in this folder to your repo root (branch: `main`).  
2. Create an empty file named `.nojekyll` in the repo root (included here).  
3. Go to **Settings → Pages** and set:

   - **Source:** Deploy from a branch  
   - **Branch:** `main`  
   - **Folder:** `/ (root)`  
4. Wait ~1 minute and open: `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo>/`

## 🧩 Features
- Instant ad scoring (hook, specificity, readability, CTA, benefits, proof, policy hints)
- Static creative check via edge-density on uploaded screenshots
- Copy to clipboard & download text report
- 100% client-side — no backend required

## 📝 Notes
- The “Ad Library content” box only shows a message unless you add a small CORS proxy.
- For best results, paste primary text/headline and upload 1–3 static screenshots.
